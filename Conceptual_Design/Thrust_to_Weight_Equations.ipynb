    "This workbook is based on equations from <u>General Aircraft Design: Applied Methods and Procedures</u> Chapter 3 Constraint Analysis and Example 3-1 on Page 64, ref 1 above.  This chapter contains constraint equations that relate the thrust loading, thrust to weight ratio (T/W or tw for ease of use with Python) of an aircraft, to its wing loading, weight to reference surface area ratio (W/S or ws for ease of use with Python) at several critical (from a conceptual design standpoint) stages of flight.  \n",

    "<li>Takeoff T/W</li>\n",
    "<li>Climb T/W</li>\n",
    "<li>Cruise T/W</li>\n",

    "# Using Constraint Analysis to discover critical aircraft preformance questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraint analysis is based on finding the minimum value of a variable that meets a set of requirements.  In the case of conceptual aircraft design, we use the equations that describe TW  as a function of WS to determine the required horsepower of our aircraft engine for the above 5 flight critical stages.  From this data, we can visually identify the portion of these curves, when plotted together, that show the minimum power loading that meets our requirements.  From this power loading and the associated wing loading, we can determine the minimum engine horsepower, wing reference surface area, and confirm our stall speed, and maximum coefficient of lift, for takeoff.\n"
